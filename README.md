## Movies App

The application is written in Kotlin.
The application displays a list of movies after entering three characters in the search field.

## Left to be done

1) REST communication with the API with usage of Retrofit library.

2) Room data base for caching search results for movies.

3) Better looking UI.

4) Full MVVM architecture
Now there are only View -> ViewModel -> Repository layers
API layer and data base layer should be added.

5) DAO layer.

6) Room data base can be used.

7) Dependency injection library can be added (Koin, Kodein, Dagger 2 or Hilt)

8) Separate views for smartphones and tablets also can be added.

9) Unit test needs to be added.
